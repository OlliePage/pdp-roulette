This is a simple script that suggests what to do with your personal development time, using a simple weighted 
roulette idea. We'll spin a wheel, (progress bar?) and spit out what the answer should be, with resources to that answer
i.e a url to kaggle notebooks to dig into. And it may also start a timer. 


Potential output:
Kaggle Notebooks: have a look into new techniques and best practices for EDA, Feature Engineering, Algorithm useage 
Academic Articles: read one of the papers in the `to_read` directory
Crack open a textbook: read one of the textbooks in the `text_books` directory
Side project: carry on with your side project and work through that as a technical learning opportunity 
Youtube Lecture: find a few lectures on youtube that talk about programming 
MOOC Course: continue with MOOC from the udacity courses, or udemy courses
 
 ### REQUIREMENTS ##
Each output has a potential weighting, which can be adjusted. The default will be equally distributed. 

### FUTURE WORK ##

Have a live routlette wheel (spinning pie chart?) with a slice being highlighted when its selected, to show what work to do
